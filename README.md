# LLM Applications

This repository showcases some interesting LLM use cases, specifically in search and information retrieval systems.

## Building a metadata augmented hybrid search system
I developed hybrid search algorithm combining keyword and semantic search methodologies to significantly enhance result accuracy for users. Specifically tailored for an Amazon toy dataset, this Capstone project involves:
- Extracting metadata using the OpenAI API
- Converting texts into embeddings using sentence transformer models
- Building an interactive tool using Streamlit
